Simple IDE for developing Tingbot apps on the Mac. Download from the [releases page](http://github.com/tingbot/tide/releases/). Python API documentation at [tingbot-python.readthedocs.org](http://tingbot-python.readthedocs.org/).

If you're on Windows or Linux, check out our [cross-platform port to Electron](https://github.com/tingbot/tide-electron), which is still in development.

We were successfully funded on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/744235676/647977615) in December 2015. Thanks to all our backers!
